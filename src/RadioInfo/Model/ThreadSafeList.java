/**
 * Description:     A list, which all of it's methods are thread safe.
 *                  ThreadSafeList uses an ArrayList of CopySafe objects. It's
 *                  methods are all synchronized, and all returned items from
 *                  the list are copies and not actual references. Thus the
 *                  returned objects can be manipulated without changing the
 *                  actual objects in ThreadSafeList.
